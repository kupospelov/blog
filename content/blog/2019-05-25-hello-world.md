I start a small blog to post occasional notes on topics that I find useful or interesting. This post is probably the best place to describe how I set it up.

The blog is built with [Cobalt](https://github.com/cobalt-org/cobalt.rs), the static site generator. I could just install Jekyll, but since I do not use Ruby and its toolchain, I checked other options first. So I found Cobalt and it has worked flawlessly! Check it out if you want to build a simple static web site.

I used some styles and templates from [Johann's blog](http://johannh.me), but customized them to my own liking. This blog has a similar layout, but I stripped everything down to the minimum, so there are no JavaScript files or external fonts at this point.

That is it. Stay tuned!
