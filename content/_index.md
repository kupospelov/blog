title: About
---
My name is Konstantin. I write programs.

In my spare time, I sometimes contribute to free and open-source software. I created a ctags plugin for [vis](https://github.com/martanne/vis), implemented the join command for [uutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils), and sent a number of patches to other projects.

I am also interested in photography. Whenever I travel, I grab my camera and capture moments. After a long time of post-processing, I publish them. Check out some of my shots!
